## `code-starter` Branch - OMH Auth Client Library

This branch contains the basic starting codebase for the OMH Auth Client Library. If you are new to the library, we recommend using the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/openmobilehub/omh-auth#clone-the-repository) in the main branch's README.md file to learn how to incorporate the client library into your project.
